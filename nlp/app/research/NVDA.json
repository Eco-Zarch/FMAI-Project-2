        "content": "Nvidia has been an amazing stock to own over the past few years, generating incredible returns for investors. But the risk is that expectations may be too high for the stock, especially with respect to artificial intelligence (AI). And that means the stock could be vulnerable to a sell-off if reality doesn't align with the sky-high expectations investors and consumers have created for AI.The future of AI is difficult to predict. What's much more predictable is the need for healthcare, and the growing demand that will come from a larger and aging population. And in that sense, investors may be better off considering investing in some unstoppable healthcare stocks that are poised for a lot of growth in the years to come. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) may be safer growth stocks for investors to consider than Nvidia. Here's why these stocks look so attractive right now.1. Eli LillyEli Lilly has become the most valuable healthcare stock in the world with a market cap of around $700 billion. But there's still much more room for it to rise in value, for two big reasons: Mounjaro and Zepbound. The former is its diabetes drug and the latter is its weight loss drug. Both are essentially the same as they contain the active ingredient tirzepatide, but they are approved for different indications. Combined, they could generate at least $50 billion in annual sales at their peaks. For a company that reported $34 billion in sales for all of last year, that could be an incredible amount of growth on the horizon for Eli Lilly.And there are many obesity-related issues and illnesses that could benefit from tirzepatide, meaning there's potential for it to obtain approval for more indications, leading to even greater possible upside. For example, in a clinical trial, tirzepatide has shown that it is effective in helping to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, a form of fatty liver disease.On top of this, there's also Eli Lilly's early Alzheimer's treatment, donanemab, which may obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year, and that, too, could be a blockbuster drug and generate billions in revenue for the business.Eli Lilly's stock isn't cheap, trading at more than 120 times its trailing earnings. But with so much growth on the horizon, this could still make for a fantastic long-term buy. The healthcare stock may be the first to reach $1 trillion in market cap. There's a significant need to treat Alzheimer's, obesity, and diabetes, and if the company can have products that can help all of those areas, then Eli Lilly could truly be an unstoppable stock to own in the long run.Story continues2. Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is similar to Eli Lilly in that it has a couple of top diabetes and weight loss treatments. Although it is approved for diabetes, Ozempic has been popular on social media for its ability to help people lose weight. Wegovy is the company's rising star in weight loss, and Novo Nordisk is rolling it out to more countries around the world. Demand is so significant for its drugs that Novo Nordisk has been investing billions in additional capacity.In March, the FDA approved Wegovy as a treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk in obese and overweight individuals. With that approval, more health insurance companies are planning to provide coverage for the treatment as it is becomes evident that it can be more than just an effective weight loss drug. Ozempic, meanwhile, has demonstrated in a recent clinical trial that it can reduce the risk that kidney diseases progresses in patients.As more trials are done, there could be even more possible uses uncovered for these treatments, leading to regulators approving the drug for additional indications. The demand is significant enough in obesity and diabetes that there's room for both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to have stellar drugs in these categories and for both businesses to thrive. Rather than picking a winner between them, investors may want to consider owning both.At 47 times earnings, Novo Nordisk is a cheaper buy but it is a bit less diversified than Eli Lilly. However, it also looks like an unstoppable stock.3. UnitedHealth GroupUnitedHealth Group is a leading health insurance company in the country. It doesn't have any major, game-changing drugs in its portfolio, but its business can still generate impressive numbers over the years as the number of patients needing healthcare coverage increases. And that's likely to happen as the number of seniors rises in the years ahead.The company has also been investing in expanding its operations. Last year, it acquired LHC Group, an in-home healthcare company. It is also in the process of acquiring another similar company, Amedisys; however, that deal hasn't closed yet.UnitedHealth is a massive business already. It generated more than $370 billion in revenue last year and its profit came in at over $22 billion. In the long run, it expects that its earnings will grow by around 13% to 16%.The company has faced some bad press lately due to a data breach involving its subsidiary, Change Healthcare, but that shouldn't dissuade investors from owning what's a top healthcare company in UnitedHealth Group, which has a ton of growth potential. Its recent earnings numbers were weighed down by the effects of the recent cyber attack but based on its estimated future profits, UnitedHealth Group looks cheap -- it trades at a multiple of only 18.Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

        "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4119ade0-4561-351b-916b-14efd58144fa/the-low-cost-etf-that-has.html",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can offer you an easy way to gain exposure to a lot of stocks through just a single investment. But that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice good returns in the process.Growth-focused ETFs can generate strong, market-beating returns for investors while also providing excellent diversification. One ETF that has been a particularly good investment over the past decade is the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index (NYSEMKT: FTEC).Low fees but high returnsThe Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF comes with a fairly light expense ratio of just 0.08%. That's important as higher fees can chip away at your returns over time. But that's not the case with this Fidelity fund, making it an attractive option for long-term investors.In the past 10 years, the fund has risen in value by around 440%, dwarfing the S&P 500 and its 170% gain during that stretch. In fact, that's an even better return than the popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which invests in the top 100 non-financial companies on the Nasdaq. When including dividends, the total returns come out to 505% for the Fidelity fund, 435% for Invesco, and 225% for the broad market.If you had invested $10,000 into the Fidelity fund a decade ago, it would be worth more than $58,000 now with dividends reinvested.Why has the Fidelity tech-focused fund done so well?The top three stocks in the Fidelity and Invesco funds are the same: Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. But what's different is how much each fund allocates to those stocks.StockFTEC AllocationQQQ AllocationMicrosoft17.8%8.8%Apple14.7%7.6%Nvidia11.9%6.2%Data source: Invesco, Fidelity.The Fidelity fund has allocated more than 44% to those three stocks versus less than 23% for the Invesco fund. Despite having more than 300 holdings, Fidelity's fund is less diverse among its top holdings than the Invesco QQQ Trust is.When a fund's top stocks are doing well and it has significant exposure to them, that can lead to some incredible returns for investors. The risk, however, is that with valuations being high, the Fidelity fund may be vulnerable to a steeper correction if those heavily-weighted stocks falter.Is the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF still a good buy?If you're bullish on Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia more so than other tech stocks, then investing in the Fidelity fund can still be a great option right now. If your focus is on the long run, however, a sounder strategy may be for less concentration in just three stocks, which is why the Invesco fund and other options may be more appropriate for investors from here on out.Story continuesBoth funds, however, can still generate excellent investments, given the opportunities in artificial intelligence and for technological advancements to propel leading companies to new heights. The key takeaway, however, is that just because you invest in ETFs doesn't mean you can't target high-growth areas and earn great returns along the way.Should you invest $1,000 in Fidelity Covington Trust - Fidelity Msci Information Technology Index ETF right now?Before you buy stock in Fidelity Covington Trust - Fidelity Msci Information Technology Index ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Fidelity Covington Trust - Fidelity Msci Information Technology Index ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't just a leader in developing the key hardware fueling the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It's a big investor in other AI companies, often including an equity investment in its business relationships. In December, its portfolio of AI stocks surpassed the $100 million threshold, requiring it to file form 13-F with the SEC disclosing all of its holdings.Nvidia's portfolio isn't very broad, containing just five stocks, and 97% of the portfolio is concentrated in just two holdings.The biggest piece of Nvidia's portfolio is ARM Holdings, the chip architecture company the AI giant tried to purchase for $40 billion in 2020. It ended up grabbing a stake worth $190 million at its current price, representing just a small slice of the $100 billion company.Image source: Nvidia.Nvidia's second-largest holding represents a much more meaningful stake in an innovative AI company. This company has also found favor with Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, which bought more shares earlier this month, adding to its position as the company's largest shareholder. Importantly, investors can still invest in the stock near the same level Nvidia did last July. It's no wonder Wood and her team have been snapping up shares recently.Nvidia's second-largest holding is a 3.4% stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX). The company is using AI to mine data and discover new potential drugs. And if it successfully develops a breakthrough medicine, it could easily turn into Nvidia's biggest investment.Harnessing AI to move faster and reduce costsRecursion is a biotech company that aims to improve the drug discovery process by using big data and AI. It combines public datasets and its own proprietary data to discover new potential compounds. It then uses its algorithms to filter its compounds into viable candidates for development to treat rare diseases or precisely target certain cancers.Recursion says that its process reduces the number of development candidates from its initial screen to less than 10% of what a traditional drug discovery company might. That allows it to focus only on options with the highest chance of success, enabling it to spend less and move faster.It currently has five treatments in phase 2 clinical trials. Each one treats a patient population of less than 1 million, with most treating populations of less than 100,000. That means that if it succeeds in bringing one of these treatments to market, it will likely be the only competitor serving that population.If Recursion can prove that its method is consistently more successful, faster, and more cost-effective than others in the industry, it presents a lot of opportunities. Not only can it continue to discover and develop new treatments, but it can also license its platform to other drugmakers working in more complex areas. That can provide up-front capital to expand its operations.Story continuesThe company already has partnerships in place with Roche and Bayer to help discover oncology targets and neuroscience therapies.Should you invest with Nvidia and Cathie Wood?Investing in Recursion is a big bet on the company's process paying off in a viable drug.The company currently generates revenue primarily through its collaborative agreements with other drugmakers. That generated a total of $44 million for the company last year, up from $40 million in 2022.Meanwhile, it's burning through cash as it works to discover and develop drugs while building out its AI platform. R&D expenses climbed to $241 million last year, up from $156 million the year before. And total operating losses climbed to $350 million from $246 million.The company ended last year with $392 million in cash on its balance sheet, which gives it some runway. But it will likely need to raise more cash soon to continue funding its operations. That'll likely come through equity investments, which could dilute shareholder's stakes.All this makes Recursion a risky investment. The payoff could be huge, though. It's a relatively small company with a market capitalization of $1.85 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for the overall pharmaceutical industry, which generated around $1.6 trillion last year in sales.For investors looking for a home run stock, you wouldn't have bad company investing in Recursion. Nvidia backs it along with several other members of the AI and pharma industries, and Cathie Wood has made it one of the biggest holdings in her genomics-focused ETF. But it's also possible you could swing and miss.Should you invest $1,000 in Recursion Pharmaceuticals right now?Before you buy stock in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Recursion Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

        "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-top-15-stock-125416704.html",
        "content": "In this article, we'll take a look into Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.Established in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs has evolved into the world's second-largest investment bank by revenue, amassing $1.65 billion in fees during the first quarter of 2024. From its modest origins in a one-room basement office adjacent to a coal chute, the bank has expanded steadily over the years. In 1906, it made its mark in the initial public offering (IPO) market with the iconic Sears, Roebuck, & Co. Goldman Sachs was among the pioneers in emphasizing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over book values for company valuation.Banks are intricately linked to the fluctuations in interest rates due to their core function of dealing with money. While consumers may lament higher rates, banks often welcome them as they can widen their profit margins, known as the 'spread,' even amidst reduced borrowing demand during tighter monetary conditions. However, higher interest rates can challenge banks to manage their asset base, including funds invested in securities like bonds. Sharp rate fluctuations necessitate the revaluation of these securities, potentially resulting in losses that could jeopardize the stability of even the most profitable of banks. This was evident in the US banking crisis of 2023, particularly impacting Goldman Sachs, which reported a substantial $470 million loss in its loan portfolio during the first quarter of that year. This loss was part of the bank's efforts to restructure its retail banking division in response to the challenging environment.Despite grappling with such challenges a year ago as it ventured into Main Street endeavors, Goldman Sachs came back strong by refocusing on its core strengths. In the first quarter of this year, it surpassed analyst expectations by nearly $1 billion, garnering close to $4 billion in earnings, largely driven by substantial profits in its trading and corporate advisory divisions. While analysts anticipated a turnaround in deal-making activities, Goldman Sachs exceeded this forecast. Notably, the bank's investment banking fees soared by an impressive 32% in the latest results, reaching $2.08 billion. Additionally, the consumer banking division reported a noteworthy 24% revenue growth, marking a refreshing change after years of costly losses and write-downs.Story continuesDespite the investment bank's surge in revenues, its net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters were a mere $23 million for the first quarter of 2024, a notable reduction compared to the previous year. Additionally, Goldman Sachs trimmed its workforce by 2% following the sale of home lending firm GreenSky in October. This divestiture aligns with the bank's recent strategic shift away from consumer banking to prioritize its core offerings: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite incurring a $506 million loss from the sale in 2023, CEO David Solomon remains optimistic, citing the resurgence of capital markets and promising business prospects in Goldman's core sectors as the catalysts for the bank's turnaround. These results were especially gratifying for the bank, coming shortly after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) experienced its sharpest stock decline in almost four years, acknowledging a more challenging outlook than previously expected.Curious about Goldman Sachs' outlook for the future? Here's a glimpse into what its management said during its first-quarter 2024 earnings call:In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows.It’s important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients’ needs. And we’re growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.Amidst a backdrop of cautious optimism brewing at JPMorgan, we've scrutinized its leading stock selections. Noteworthy among them are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024Our MethodologyTo compile our roster of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we reviewed the bank's submissions to the SEC, pinpointing its 15 most substantial investment holdings.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) was mentioned by Tsai Capital Corporation in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm commented:“Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.”6.

        "content": "April 19 featured one of the most drastic tech-led sell-offs we've seen in a while, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) falling 10% in a single session. All of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks got hit hard on Friday and led the Nasdaq Composite to fall 5.5% in a week.The Magnificent Seven is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett and includes Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.Here are three moves you can make to brace for a prolonged market sell-off.Image source: Getty Images.1. Double-check your exposureOne of the most common mistakes investors make is to overly align themselves with a certain theme, sector, or type of stock.The easiest way for this to happen is that similar stocks go up more than the rest of your portfolio and then make up a larger percentage. This is exactly what has happened in the S&P 500, which is now comprised of 29.7% tech stocks.If you have held outperforming growth stocks for some time, your portfolio might have a higher allocation to growth than a few years ago.Another important factor to check is your exposure to stocks in exchange-traded funds and index funds. Every $100 invested in the S&P 500 is really about $30 in tech and $70 in the rest of the market. Out of every $100 invested in the Nasdaq Composite, over $40 goes into the Magnificent Seven.Many companies are also correlated to Magnificent Seven stocks. For example, if Nvidia gets hit hard, other chip stocks will also go down (precisely what played out during the April 19 sell-off).Understanding how your portfolio will likely perform in different situations can help you better manage your holdings and adjust your allocation with your investment objectives.2. Revisit investment thesesWhen volatility spikes, it's easy to get more emotional about investing. One way to counter emotions, on both the upside and the downside, is to have a clearly defined investment thesis for each stock you own.It's easier to let a winner run or have the patience to hold a stock when it sells off if you have clear expectations for a company. For example, a good reason for owning Microsoft is because of its rock-solid balance sheet, massive free cash flow generation, steadily growing dividend and buyback program, diversified business model, growing margins and sales, and its ability to invest in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, and other growth outlets without jeopardizing the strength of the business.In this vein, owning Microsoft isn't just about what it does in the coming quarter or year, but how it is positioned to capitalize on megatrends and return value to shareholders. Of course, investors want to make sure the valuation doesn't get out of hand, but it would take a seismic blunder for Microsoft's investment thesis to derail.Story continuesThe most volatile Magnificent Seven stock is probably Nvidia, which collapsed 10% on April 19 and fell nearly 13.9% last week.^IXIC ChartThe harsh reality is that if a move like that scares you, it might be best not to own Nvidia at all -- which is perfectly OK.Growth stocks like Nvidia aren't for everyone, and it takes a specific kind of risk tolerance to own them outright. For many investors, it might be better to get exposure to a company like Nvidia through an inexpensive fund like the Vanguard Growth ETF, where Nvidia is a top holding but is part of a diversified set of growth-focused stocks.3. Regularly contribute to your portfolioInvestors who regularly commit new savings to their portfolios could see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, especially now that valuations have become more attractive.It's never a good feeling to have no inflows in your portfolio and be 100% invested in stocks so that you have to sell or reduce a position to buy something else.Contributing cash regularly to a portfolio, even a tiny amount, provides the dry powder needed to put capital to work during a sell-off without selling a stock at a big loss.The path forwardYour approach to the sell-off in Magnificent Seven stocks will depend on your specific situation and portfolio needs. For example, if you go through a portfolio check and find out you already have plenty of exposure to the theme, you might want to do nothing.If you find out you own a stock for the wrong reasons after revisiting an investment thesis, you might want to consider what changes need to be made to get your portfolio back on track. If you are looking for more exposure to growth, you could allocate a higher percentage of new portfolio contributions to your favorite Magnificent Seven companies. Or you could instead consider ETFs that are concentrated in growth stocks.Most importantly, if you are a young investor or have a long time horizon, you will likely be a net buyer of stocks in the future, not a seller. In this position, sell-offs can actually work to your advantage.Understanding that long-term financial goals are far more important than how green or red your portfolio looks on a given day can help calm emotions and help you make grounded investment decisions, especially when there's a lot of noise in the market.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The latest example comes from RockAuto, an auto parts dealer popular with home mechanics and other DIYers, which is upset that a fake app masquerading as its official app has not been removed from the App Store, despite numerous complaints to Apple.RockAuto co-founder and president Jim Taylor was first alerted to the situation when customers began complaining about \\\"annoying ads\\\" in its app -- something he said \\\"surprised us since we don't have an app.\\\"Fake RockAuto app on the App Store. Image Credits: Apple (screen capture by TechCrunch)\\\"We discovered someone placed an app in the Apple App Store using our logo and company information -- but with the misspellings and clumsy graphics typical of phishing schemes,\\\" he told TechCrunch.On closer inspection, the fake app doesn't look very legit, but it's easy to see how someone could be fooled. Its App Store images show a photo of a truck with the word \\\"Heading\\\" across the image as if a template was hastily used and the work was unfinished. In addition, despite being titled \\\"RockAuto\\\" on the App Store, the app refers to itself as \\\"RackAuto\\\" throughout its App Store description.What's more, it promises customers that \\\"Your privacy is a top priority\\\" and that \\\"all your data is securely stored and encrypted, giving you peace of mind.\\\" That's not likely, given the nature of this app.The issue is not only concerning because of the app's ability to fool at least some portion of RockAuto's customers but also because it undermines Apple's messaging about how the App Store is a trusted and secure marketplace -- which is why it demands a cut of developers' in-app purchase transactions. The tech giant has been fighting back against regulations like the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), by claiming these laws would compromise customer safety and privacy. Apple believes that customers will be at risk if they conduct business outside its App Store with unknown parties. But, as these cases show, bad actors can too easily infiltrate its own app marketplace as well.Image Credits: Fake RockAuto app on the App Store. Image Credits: Apple (screen capture by TechCrunch)Apple has so far ignored RockAuto's requests to remove the fake app, which were all sent through proper channels, according to documentation the company shared with TechCrunch.While searching for a solution to this problem, RockAuto came across our coverage of a similar situation with LastPass. The password manager was also the victim of a similar scheme when a fake app pretending to be LastPass was live on the App Store for weeks. LastPass eventually had to warn its customers publicly in a blog post, as Apple had not yet taken the fake app down until after the press coverage and LastPass's own post went live.Story continuesApple didn't respond to requests for comment at the time. The company wasn't immediately available for requests for comment about RockAuto's complaint either.Apple pulled a fake app masquerading as password manager LastPass from the App StoreTaylor says that RockAuto's Customer Service manager initially reached out to Apple to resolve the situation. When he didn't get a response, Taylor got involved.\\\"It's mostly one-way since the only replies we've had from Apple are 'you shouldn't have emailed, go use the online form' and 'upload screen prints of the app store listing and your trademark registration,'\\\" Taylor explains, both of which RockAuto had already done, its documentation indicates.\\\"Neither the uploaded documents nor the online form submissions produced any response at all,\\\" Taylor noted, \\\"not even the promised 'case number in 24 hours' despite multiple submissions,\\\" he said.Since filing the complaint on April 18, 2024, RockAuto has shared its trademark registration with Apple, emailed the company, called the number provided on Apple's copyright infringement page, sent a DMCA Takedown request and filled out Apple's required forms.It has not received anything other than automated responses and the fake app remains live as of the time of publication.Update, 4/29/24: The company has now informed TechCrunch the fake app was removed.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5184ae6c-9d40-4a0f-bd0f-8c95dce80ca0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5184ae6c-9d40-4a0f-bd0f-8c95dce80ca0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zacharywiel/Documents/NLP/project-finance/nlp/research/AAPL.json", "file_name": "AAPL.json", "file_type": "application/json", "file_size": 17557, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa347c82-ebd8-450a-b539-04a760a0a151", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zacharywiel/Documents/NLP/project-finance/nlp/research/AAPL.json", "file_name": "AAPL.json", "file_type": "application/json", "file_size": 17557, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "62361cd6d0f1316e52d462e9124bf9bc67800c760ecc1e78c8d5a3f387b20762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfc655db-739b-43ce-89d9-6593f747edd7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zacharywiel/Documents/NLP/project-finance/nlp/research/AAPL.json", "file_name": "AAPL.json", "file_type": "application/json", "file_size": 17557, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "5bd5cda01a42cd8fa3bec485a1d3bc23583ed371af9e2a1321a977d94306d060", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6924266e-470d-4144-b7c2-be4c4d85b5fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e18a9f31b4dff0e2c618f614a4671ee793d0289e5a5385bb005bf8877b0f1f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "After publication of our article, and attempts to reach Apple, RockAuto received an email from Apple that the infringing app was being taken down later in the day on Friday.\\\"After weeks of ignoring us, Apple took down the fake app just hours after your article appeared,\\\" Taylor told us.Apple\u2019s reluctant, punitive compliance with regulators will burn its political and developer goodwillThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/apple-hasnt-yet-removed-obviously-fake-app-pretending-to-be-rockauto/View comments\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"Tesla bounces back, SoFi down on Q2 forecast: Market check\",\n        \"url\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-bounces-back-sofi-down-205957583.html\",\n        \"content\": \"US Equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) recovered toward the end of the day as news broke concerning the US Treasury's larger-than-expected borrowing plans.

Why the quick silicon refresh? Well, for starters, word on the street is that Apple launched the M3 later than expected (likely owing to supply chain issues), forcing the company to launch all three chips at the same event.Image Credits: AppleCouple that with the fact that Microsoft is rumored to be launching its own third-party silicon at Build at the end of May, and you start to understand why the company opted not to wait. An announcement may be even more pressing, given that the Microsoft/ARM chips are said to offer \u201cindustry-leading performance\\\" -- an apparent shot across Apple's bow. Could a new chip also mean new Macs? That would be a short refresh cycle for the current crop, but it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.What does seem certain, however, is a new iPad Pro with an OLED display, a 12.9-inch iPad Air and new gestures for the Apple Pencil.

It\u2019s worth noting that revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion throughout the quarter, down 13% from the year-ago period.For the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in China stands at $16.6 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago period. As shown below, AAPL\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases, with the most recent miss totaling $2.5 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcerning the Services portfolio, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $23.3 billion, 11.5% higher than the $20.9 billion reported in the year-ago period.

Nvidia's products have formed the backbone of the computing infrastructure that makes apps like ChatGPT work.But Nvidia won't have this space to itself forever. Competition is coming from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as the big tech companies that make up a significant chunk of its customer base like Apple, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, which are working on their AI hardware to reduce their dependency on Nvidia.Nvidia isn't a bad buy right now, but there is some downside risk in the stock since it's jumped nearly 500% since the start of 2023. That was evident when the stock fell 10% on April 19 on little more than fears of a bubble bursting in AI stocks.For investors who want an AI stock that isn't at risk of a bubble popping, keep reading to see two that are well positioned for long-term growth.Image source: Getty Images.1. MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been in the AI limelight ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT. That makes sense. After all, Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI, having invested an estimated $13 billion in the start-up, and Microsoft's AI strategy hinges on OpenAI's products and collaborations to a large extent.Unlike a hardware company like Nvidia, Microsoft has a wide range of ways to capitalize on the AI boom. It's integrated generative AI technologies into products like its Azure cloud infrastructure service, GitHub code repository tools, Microsoft Office suite, Bing search engine, and others. The company has rolled out Copilot, which it calls its AI-powered productivity tool, across a range of products, and CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's recent earnings report, \\\"Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry.\\\"Microsoft may not have the explosive growth that Nvidia has delivered, but it's hard to doubt Microsoft's AI bona fides given its close relationship with OpenAI, dominance of enterprise software, and diversification across businesses like Windows, gaming, and cloud computing.Investors cheered the tech giant's latest earnings report, sending the stock up after hours on Thursday after it easily beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.Story continuesEven if Nvidia's growth suddenly slows, Microsoft should be an AI winner regardless of what happens in the chip sector.2.

The announcement follows rival Intel\u2019s disappointing report last week. While Intel (INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines, the company provided lower-than-anticipated revenue guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding.Investors and analysts will be looking at two key metrics during AMD\u2019s report: AI chip sales and PC market performance. The company released its MI300 line of AI accelerators in December 2023 and began shipping units shortly thereafter. How well those chips are selling could have a large impact on AMD\u2019s shares following the earnings announcement.Wall Street expects earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61 on revenue of $5.45 billion. That would mark a slight increase from the same quarter last year when AMD reported EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $5.35 billion.AMD\u2019s MI300 chips are meant to go head-to-head with Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) best-selling H100 line of accelerators. The company previously said that its MI300X beats out Nvidia\u2019s chips, a claim Nvidia rejected. Intel is also chasing Nvidia\u2019s H100 platform with its Gaudi 3 accelerators.Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, speaks onstage during Vox Media's 2023 Code Conference at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel on Sept. 26, 2023, in Dana Point, Calif. (Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox Media) (Jerod Harris via Getty Images)Nvidia, however, announced its follow-up to the H100, the Blackwell platform, during its GTC conference in March. This platform should offer better performance than its predecessor.The AI arms race isn\u2019t slowing anytime soon, either. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) each announced that they\u2019re pouring money into AI data center capabilities to build out and support their various software offerings.But whether AMD can steal significant market share away from market leader Nvidia remains to be seen. According to UBS Global Research analyst Timothy Arcuri, MI300X sales should bring in billions this year.\u201cWe still very much see $5 billion to $6 billion as still conservative for MI300 revenue this year and we also see guidance being fine,\u201d he wrote in an investor note ahead of earnings.For the quarter, Wall Street is anticipating Data Center revenue of $2.31 billion, which would equate to a year-over-year increase of 78% versus the same period last year.Outside of AI sales, Wall Street will be looking at the recovery in the PC market and its impact on AMD\u2019s sales. According to IDC, global PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter of 2024, marking the first quarter of growth after two years of declines.Intel already reported a 31% year-over-year bump in Client Group revenue, the company\u2019s PC chip segment, in its latest quarter. That should bode well for AMD. Both companies are pushing their own AI PCs, or laptops and desktops that can run generative AI apps locally rather than via the web.Story continuesAnalysts are calling for AMD Client revenue, the segment that includes PC chip sales, to jump 74% year over year to $1.29 billion in the quarter.But Intel and AMD aren\u2019t the only companies pushing for a slice of the AI PC market. Qualcomm (QCOM) is angling for its own cut with its new Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips for laptops.Despite healthy growth projections for its Data Center and Client segments, Wall Street is expecting the company\u2019s Gaming and Embedded divisions to tumble 45% and 40%, respectively.Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.
